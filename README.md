## Business Objective
The main objective was to aid companies in predicting the prices of trending sneakers, leveraging social media metrics from TikTok and pricing trends from Mercari. This prediction enables companies to strategically manage promotions, collaborations, and pricing strategies based on the lifecycle of product trends.

## Methodology
We employed predictive analytics using a Random Forest Regression model, incorporating variables like selling price, discounts, and social media engagement metrics. Detailed analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between TikTok engagement and Mercari selling prices, guiding dynamic pricing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **PySpark** for handling large datasets and performing distributed data processing.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive documentation of our analysis process.

## Results
Our model achieved an 85% accuracy in forecasting optimal prices, demonstrating strong potential for enhancing pricing strategies and marketing efforts. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to help companies tailor their strategies to capitalize on emerging trends and maximize market performance.
